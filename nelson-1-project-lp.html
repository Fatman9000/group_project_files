                <p>Weezer is an American rock band formed in Los Angeles, California, in 1992. Since 2001, the band has
                    consisted of Rivers Cuomo (lead vocals, lead guitar, keyboards), Patrick Wilson (drums, percussion,
                    backing vocals), Brian Bell (rhythm guitar, backing vocals, keyboards), and Scott Shriner (bass,
                    backing vocals, keyboards). After signing to Geffen Records in 1993, Weezer released their
                    self-titled debut album, also known as the Blue Album, in May 1994. Backed by music videos for the
                    singles "Buddy Holly", "Undone – The Sweater Song", and "Say It Ain't So", the Blue Album became a
                    multiplatinum success. Weezer's second album, Pinkerton (1996), featuring a darker, more abrasive
                    sound, was a commercial failure and initially received mixed reviews, but achieved cult status and
                    critical acclaim years later.</p>
